## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Widgets don't show up / buttons don't work
- **Solution**: Run this in terminal: `jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension`
- Restart Jupyter after running the command

**Problem**: Import errors
- **Solution**: The first cell installs packages automatically. Make sure it ran successfully.

**Problem**: Charts don't display
- **Solution**: Run `%matplotlib inline` in a cell before the chart cells

**Problem**: Can't record screen
- **Solution**: Use Loom.com (free, web-based, very easy)
