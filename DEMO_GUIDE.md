### INTRODUCTION (30-45 seconds)

**[Show login screen]**

"Hello! I'm excited to present my K-12 Learning Management System prototype for Dynamic Active. This platform is designed to be intuitive for both teachers and students, while incorporating AI-powered features that personalize the learning experience.

As you can see on the login screen, the system supports both teacher and student accounts. Let me walk you through the key features from both perspectives."

---

### TEACHER PERSPECTIVE (2-3 minutes)

**[Click "Ms. Johnson" button]**

"Let's start by logging in as Ms. Johnson, a 7th-grade teacher. 

**[Navigate to 'My Courses' tab if not already there]**

"In the teacher dashboard, we can see all courses at a glance. Ms. Johnson teaches Grade 7 Mathematics and Science, with multiple students enrolled in each course.

**[Click 'Grade Assignments' tab]**

"Now, here's where the AI really shines. In the grading section, we can see pending submissions that need review. Let me demonstrate the AI-assisted grading feature."

**[Click "🤖 AI Grade" button on a submission]**

"With one click, the AI analyzes the submission and provides an intelligent grade along with personalized feedback and actionable suggestions. This saves teachers significant time while still providing quality, individualized feedback to students. Notice how the AI considers the assignment difficulty and provides specific recommendations for improvement.

**[Click 'Create Assignment' tab]**

"Creating new assignments is straightforward. Teachers can specify the course, title, description, points, difficulty level, and due date. The difficulty setting helps the AI provide appropriate recommendations to students later.

**[Click 'Analytics' tab]**

"The analytics tab gives teachers valuable insights into class performance. We can see average scores, grade distributions, and identify students who might need extra support. This data-driven approach helps teachers make informed decisions about their instruction."

### STUDENT PERSPECTIVE (2-3 minutes)

**[Click logout button, then click "Emma Wilson"]**

"Now let's see the student experience. I'm logging in as Emma Wilson, a 7th-grade student.

**[On 'My Courses' tab]**

"Students see a clean, organized view of all their courses and assignments. Each assignment shows its status—whether it's submitted, graded, or pending. Color coding makes it easy to identify what needs attention. Assignments approaching their due date are highlighted in yellow, while overdue items appear in red.

Let me submit an assignment to show how easy the process is."

**[Type in submission text area and click Submit]**

"Just type your work and click submit. The student immediately gets confirmation, and the teacher is notified.

**[Click 'Progress' tab]**

"The Progress tab is one of my favorite features. Students can see their grade progression over time, with a clear trend line showing improvement. This visual feedback is motivating and helps students understand their academic journey. We also break down performance by individual courses.

**[Click 'AI Recommendations' tab]**

"Here's where the AI personalization really comes into play. Based on Emma's performance history, the system has identified that she excels in math but could use support in writing. The AI automatically recommends:

- A Writing Skills Lab for high-priority attention
- Advanced Math Challenge for enrichment since that's her strength  
- Appropriate study materials matched to her current skill level

These aren't generic recommendations—they're tailored specifically to Emma's performance patterns.

**[Click 'Upcoming' tab]**

"Finally, the Upcoming tab shows all pending assignments with another AI feature: performance prediction. Based on Emma's historical performance and the assignment difficulty, the AI predicts her likely score and shows whether her performance trend is improving, stable, or declining. This gives students awareness of how prepared they are and teachers early warning if intervention might be needed."

### AI FEATURES HIGHLIGHT (1 minute)

**[Navigate back to show different AI features]**

"To recap the AI innovations in this prototype:

1. **Automated Grading** - Instant, intelligent feedback that saves teacher time
2. **Personalized Learning Paths** - Recommendations based on individual strengths and weaknesses  
3. **Performance Prediction** - Forecasts to help students prepare better
4. **Adaptive Content Recommendations** - Study materials matched to skill levels
5. **Visual Analytics** - Making data accessible and actionable

These features work together to create a system that doesn't just manage learning—it actively improves it."

### CONCLUSION (30 seconds)

**[Return to login screen or show overview]**

"This prototype demonstrates how technology can empower K-12 education through three key pillars:

- **Usability**: Clean, intuitive interface for both teachers and students
- **Functionality**: Complete feature set from course management to grading to analytics  
- **AI Innovation**: Intelligent features that personalize and enhance the learning experience

The system is fully functional and ready for real-world testing. Thank you for considering my application. I'm excited about the possibility of bringing this kind of educational innovation to Dynamic Active and making a real impact on K-12 learning.

Thank you!"
