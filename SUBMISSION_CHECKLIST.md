## Emergency Troubleshooting

**Last-minute panic?** Stay calm and check:

❌ **Notebook won't run**
→ Restart Jupyter, run cells one by one
→ Check QUICK_START.md troubleshooting

❌ **Widgets not showing**
→ Run: `jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension`
→ Restart Jupyter

❌ **Video recording fails**
→ Use Loom.com (web-based, always works)
→ Or use phone to record screen (not ideal, but acceptable)

❌ **Video too long**
→ Cut introduction shorter
→ Focus on 2-3 key features per role
→ Skip repetitive demonstrations

❌ **Video too short**
→ Explain WHY features matter
→ Show more user interactions
→ Add conclusion about impact
